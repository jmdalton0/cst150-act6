### Convert Inches to Centimeters
Simple Windows Form Application to convert a length in inches to centimeters.
Added exception handling and more precision for Activity 6

### What I Learned
In this project I spent most of my time researching the best ways to format strings.
There are quite a few options, but the syntax that I liked the most was the String.Format() function.
This is similar to other print format functions that I have used in the past like printf in C.
It allows you to build a string with positions to insert variables that are also passed to the function.
These positions also work as precision filters, in this case using :F3 to format the number to 3 decimal places.
